## Why CaveSocial ?
Social Media today is a place where everyone's mind is at our disposal, but we still can't make any sense of it.
We often end up understanding entirely different things from someone's thoughts when we try to make sense out of their words and images.
The intercommunity interaction is suppressed as well because it is impossible for people who speak and understand different languages to exchange their thoughts.
In our opinion, art is above all other forms of communication and is still untapped as a means of communication. People are all artists, and art/sketch is a superior way to communicate than we currently realize.
With this idea, we propose to create a social media platform that lets users express themselves through simple drawings. As a result, we introduce Murals - a full-screen canvas where you can express yourself completely without any limitations.
Using our app, users can convey their thoughts with minimal effort and communicate with people of completely different backgrounds in an easier and more interesting way.
